#### Support:
There is much room to develop this game further. And you are welcome to contribute to improve the game. It is very much possible to create group tournaments. It is within my expertise, but I do not want to pursue that for now. Anyone who wishes to contribut to bring it into something very good and entertaining is welcome.
